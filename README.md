# Railway Track Fault Detection Robot

## Introduction
Railway transport is one of the most widely used and cost-effective means of transportation. However, accidents due to broken or cracked railway tracks continue to pose serious safety hazards. Manual inspection is time-consuming, inefficient, and prone to human error.  
This project presents a **low-cost, autonomous robot** designed to detect faults or cracks in railway tracks using **ultrasonic sensors** and report their GPS location to authorities through a **GSM module**. The system aims to enhance railway safety by providing early fault detection and real-time alert transmission.

## Principle of Operation
The system operates on the principle of **ultrasonic reflection**. When an ultrasonic wave encounters a discontinuity (such as a crack or gap) in the track surface, part of the wave is reflected back differently than from a uniform surface.  
By continuously monitoring the time of flight and amplitude of these reflections, the microcontroller identifies irregularities that indicate potential cracks. Once a fault is detected, the GPS module logs the exact coordinates, and the GSM module transmits an SMS alert containing the location.

## Working
The robot autonomously moves along the railway track using a motor-driven base. Ultrasonic sensors mounted on the front continuously scan the track surface.  
The **Arduino UNO microcontroller** measures the time interval between transmitted and received ultrasonic pulses to calculate the distance to the rail surface. If the measured distance suddenly drops below a calibrated threshold, it indicates a possible crack or discontinuity.

When such a fault is detected:
1. The **GPS module** retrieves the current coordinates (latitude and longitude).  
2. The **GSM module** sends an SMS to the monitoring center containing a message like:  
   `"Track fault detected at: LAT=28.6023, LON=77.0215"`.  
3. The fault location is also displayed on the onboard **LCD display** for confirmation.

To ensure reliable operation, the robot performs continuous sensor calibration at startup, compensating for environmental factors such as temperature and vibration. The complete system is powered by a 12V battery, enabling operation in field conditions without external supply.
